*Actual project description*

This is an art project (in the form of a Chrome extension) that is intended to demonstrate, in an experiential way, how information collected from surveillance can be manipulated and abused.

#### Why was this made?

I created this project as part of my creative seminar thesis at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in spring 2016. I have strong personal beliefs about the dangers of mass surveillance and data collection and I hope that this piece can inspire people to think critically about these issues.

#### Technical notes

**To install:** Drag the `.crx` file into Chrome -> Window -> Extensions. I highly recommend using [uBlock](https://www.ublock.org) as well, since ads can be fairly annoying and invasive.

**To try out:** Navigate to `nytimes.com`. The interface should guide you from there. Whenever you're finished, you can disable the extension by un-checking "Enabled" in Chrome -> Window -> Extensions.

**To improve:** Make sure "Developer mode" is checked in Window -> Extensions before loading the unpacked extension into Chrome. Please feel free to send a pull request, and I'll review it as quickly as possible!

The code is not in a great state right now, and could use a thorough refactoring and tests. I'll try to improve this situation as soon as I can.
